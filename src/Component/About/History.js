        <h1>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</h1>
        <p>The Divine Dominion Deliverance Church is a Prophetic and evangelical denomination
that resulted from the dynamic prophetic ministry of Prophet John Jelili Yekini who
started the historia dream interpretation in 1999.</p>

<p>The DDDC with its headquarters in Nigeria is distinctly an African church consisting of
all the basic ethnic groups in Nigeria and which identifies itself as an evangelical
church behaving to the efficacy of prayer, prophecy and divine manifestation of
God’s power <div className= "Bible">( Ps 110 vs 3)</div> </p>
<p>The church behaves in the substitutionary atonement accomplished by the death of
Christ. The church teaches that salvation is by grace through faith and not by good
works. <div className= "Bible">Titus 3:5.</div> The launch into full ministrial work began in 1999 at No 40, Morroco
Road, Shomolu, Lagos, Nigeria.</p>

<p>Initially, the church was formerly named The Dragon Destruction Deliverance Church. This was
prompted by the vision that the man of God received where God revealed the
magnitude of the assignment to do to him. He said God revealed three things to him
namely (1) Dragon (2) Destruction (3) Deliverance
According to him, the man of God said he was taken up to fight a very big Dragon,
almost half of the whole earth. He saw a little boy high up (at a higher pedestal) who
insisted that he must fight and conquer the massive animal. With divine intervention
he touched the wild dragon and the animal was totally consumed. That was how he
was instructed and mandated to destroy all the dragons in the lives of people.</p>

        <h2>THE JOURNEY SO FAR</h2>
            <p>After spending some years in Shomolu Area of Lagos state in Nigeria, West Africa.
The church moved to Owode Mile 12 and later to Owode Elede where a substantial
amount was spent to sand fill the water logged area. The church faced a lot of
persecution in the hands of “land fighters”</p>
<p>The church later moved to Okota Area in Lagos State. The Almighty God performed a
lot of miracles in the lives of His people until persecution rose again from the very
person who blessed the church with the location, one Mr. Akin. All necessary
documents were handed over to Mr. Akin. <div className= "Bible">(Hebrews 12:14) </div></p>

<h3>PRESENT LOCATION</h3>
    <p>To the glory of God, the people of God started having fellowship and prayer meetings
at Prophet’s residence at Ayobo. In the midst of troubles and persecutions God
granted another plots of land at Ayobo and church building was finally erected,
completed and ready for use till date.</p>
